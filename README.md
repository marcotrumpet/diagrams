# diagrams

This is a test project to play around with CustomPainter and an excuse to test Flutter Web and Flutter Desktop.

The main idea is to basically rewrite [draw.io](draw.io) as close as possible.
In this way I can explore and learn new stuff.

### goals

[x] have a set of basic shapes <br />
[x] draw arrows to link shapes <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(after many iteration I tryed to adapt [this](https://github.com/RafaelBarbosatec/a_star) A* algorithm to my needs) <br />
[] change arrow path
[] many, many, more
